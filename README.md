# COMP1004-FLAPPYBURB

# Overview 

Flappy Burb is a 2D Arcade-style website video game heavily inspired by Flappy Bird. The goal of the player is to control a character, "burb" through the gap of ever-generating pipes and score the highest amount of points before losing

# Project vision

This project was mainly made as a way for me to manage my self-management skills such as using time efficiently and also to provide friends and peers alike with a simple game that may potentially help them relax their minds from real life without having to put much thought into gameplay

# Core Features

- Simple and straightforward main menu with instructions on how to play the game
- Character Jump controls and gravity simulation
- Infinitely generated pipes that have a randomized gap with each spawn
- A scoring system (currently bugged)
- Music and SFX (with a volume slider aswell)
- Cartoonish graphics
